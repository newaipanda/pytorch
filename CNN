    Convolutional Kernels (Filters):
        Convolutional kernels are small-sized matrices (e.g., 3x3, 5x5) that slide over the input image (performing convolution operations).
        Each kernel can extract specific types of features, such as edges, corners, or textures.

    Feature Maps:
        Convolutional kernels convolve with the input image to generate a new matrix called a feature map or activation map.
        Each feature map reflects the presence and location of a specific feature in the input image.

    Hierarchical Feature Extraction:
        Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically consist of multiple convolutional layers, where features extracted become increasingly abstract and complex.
        Initial layers may extract simple edge and texture features, while subsequent layers may capture more complex shapes and object features.

    Activation Function:
        After the convolution operation, a nonlinear activation function (e.g., ReLU) is usually applied to increase the network's expressiveness and enable it to capture complex nonlinear features of the input data.

    Pooling Layers:
        Pooling layers usually follow convolutional layers to reduce the size of the feature maps, decrease computational load, and make the features more invariant (e.g., translation invariance).
