# bug 1  (13th May 2024): quick start in google colab: https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/070179efc13bd796c5dd4af7bf52d5b9/quickstart_tutorial.html

# STEP 1 PyTorch Version in Google Colab
# update to lasted pytorch  (2.3)

# check the verson
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.version.cuda)

# command for update to lastest
!pip3 uninstall --yes torch torchaudio torchvision torchtext torchdata
!pip3 install torch torchaudio torchvision torchtext torchdata

# STEP 2 Using Tutorial Data from Google Drive in Colab
# online folder import from Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')

# A popup window will launch:
# Permit this notebook to access your Google Drive files?
# you need to cinfirm and config the setting so google drvie and host data online 
# colab can visit that data , all in cloud

# To start, Download the data ZIP file
# https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/datasets/movie-corpus/movie-corpus.zip

# you can download then upload to google drive
# zip file can be process by right click "open with" zip extractor , online
# it can unzip the .zip file to normal fold and save all to your google drive

corpus_name = "movie-corpus"
corpus = os.path.join("/content/gdrive/My Drive/ioai", corpus_name)
# path must be full address, "/content/gdrive/My Drive/ioai", is an example 
# if create folder ioai in home folder of My Drive
